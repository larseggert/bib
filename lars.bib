	Abstract = {After a development process of many months, the TLS 1.3 specification is nearly complete. To prevent past mistakes, this crucial security protocol must be thoroughly scrutinised prior to deployment. In this work we model and analyse revision 10 of the TLS 1.3 specification using the Tamarin prover, a tool for the automated analysis of security protocols. We specify and analyse the interaction of various handshake modes for an unbounded number of concurrent TLS sessions. We show that revision 10 meets the goals of authenticated key exchange in both the unilateral and mutual authentication cases. We extend our model to incorporate the desired delayed client authentication mechanism, a feature that is likely to be included in the next revision of the specification, and uncover a potential attack in which an adversary is able to successfully impersonate a client during a PSK-resumption handshake. This observation was reported to, and confirmed by, the IETF TLS Working Group. Our work not only provides the first supporting evidence for the security of several complex protocol mode interactions in TLS 1.3, but also shows the strict necessity of recent suggestions to include more information in the protocol's signature contents.},

	Abstract = {Real-time multimedia flows comprise a large, and increasing, fraction of the traffic on the Internet. An important subset of that traffic, primarily due to interactive applications, runs over UDP/IP, and requires applications to implement congestion control to ensure the stability of the network. The IETF is developing congestion control algorithms for such uses as part of the new WebRTC standards, but there is no standard algorithm that can be used at this time. We do not propose a congestion control algorithm. Rather, we propose a circuit breaker for RTP sessions that can detect when an application is causing excessive network congestion, and shut down the transmission. This can be used as an envelope within which congestion control algorithms can operate, providing a safety net to prevent congestion collapse. We present the RTP circuit breaker algorithm, and provide an initial performance evaluation to show that it performs as desired.},

To improve transport for these applications, we present TCP Hollywood, an unordered, time-lined, TCP variant designed to support real-time multimedia traffic while being widely deployable. Analysis of the protocol indicates that it increases the utility of the network in lossy conditions where total one-way delay is constrained, such as with telephony applications and low-latency video streaming. This allows retransmissions to be useful in cases where they are not with standard TCP, improving the timely good-put of the protocol and reducing overheads. Initial experiments show that TCP Hollywood is deployable on the Internet, successfully operating on all major fixed and mobile networks in the UK, with safe failure modes.},

This has led to a proliferation of non-standard extensions, alternative APIs, and workarounds that enable new features and allow applications to make good use of the network, but are difficult to use, and require expert knowledge that is not widespread. In this paper, we present Post Sockets, a proposed new standard network API, that is designed to support modern network transport protocols and features, while raising the level of abstraction and enhancing usability. Specifically, Post Sockets aims to give portable applications the ability to use a clear, messages based, interface to multi-path and multi-stream transports, rendezvous and connection racing, and fast connection re-establishment.},

	Abstract = {Lightweight virtualization (LV) technologies have refashioned the world of software development by introducing flexibility and new ways of managing and distributing software. Edge computing complements today's powerful centralized data centers with a large number of distributed nodes that provide virtualization close to the data source and end users. This emerging paradigm offers ubiquitous processing capabilities on a wide range of heterogeneous hardware characterized by different processing power and energy availability. The scope of this article is to present an in-depth analysis on the requirements of edge computing from the perspective of three selected use cases that are particularly interesting for harnessing the power of the Internet of Things. We discuss and compare the applicability of two LV technologies, containers and unikernels, as platforms for enabling the scalability, security, and manageability required by such pervasive applications that soon may be part of our everyday lives. To inspire further research, we identify open problems and highlight future directions to serve as a road map for both industry and academia.},

RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the \ldots},

	Abstract = {Most Internet telephony applications currently use either TCP or UDP to carry their voice-over-IP (VoIP) traffic. This choice can be problematic, because TCP is not well suited for interactive traffic and UDP is unresponsive to congestion. The IETF has recently standardized the new Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). DCCP has been designed to carry media traffic and is congestion-controlled. This paper experimentally evaluates the voice quality that Internet telephony calls achieve over prototype implementations of basic DCCP and several DCCP variants, under different network conditions and with different codecs. It finds that the currently-specified DCCP variants perform less well than expected when compared to UDP and TCP. Based on an analysis of these results, the paper suggests several improvements to DCCP and experimentally validates that a prototype implementation of these modifications can significantly increase voice quality.},

In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of a linear window increase function of the current TCP standards to improve scalability and stability under fast and long-distance networks.  CUBIC and its predecessor algorithm have been adopted as defaults by Linux and have been used for many years.  This document provides a specification of CUBIC to enable third-party implementations and to solicit community feedback through experimentation on the performance of CUBIC.},

	Abstract = {This Informational RFC describes Data Center TCP (DCTCP): a TCP congestion control scheme for data-center traffic.  DCTCP extends the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) processing to estimate the fraction of bytes that encounter congestion rather than simply detecting that some congestion has occurred.  DCTCP then scales the TCP congestion window based on this estimate.  This method achieves high-burst tolerance, low latency, and high throughput with shallow- buffered switches.  This memo also discusses deployment issues related to the coexistence of DCTCP and conventional TCP, discusses the lack of a negotiating mechanism between sender and receiver, and presents some possible mitigations.  This memo documents DCTCP as currently implemented by several major operating systems.  DCTCP, as described in this specification, is applicable to deployments in controlled environments like data centers, but it must not be deployed over the \ldots},

	Abstract = {Abstract ROOT is an object-oriented C++ framework conceived in the high-energy physics (HEP) community, designed for storing and analyzing petabytes of data in an efficient way. Any instance of a C++ class can be stored into a ROOT file in a machine-independent compressed binary format. In ROOT the TTree object container is optimized for statistical data analysis over very large data sets by using vertical data storage techniques. These containers can span a large number of files on local disks, the web, or a number of different shared file systems. In order to analyze this data, the user can chose out of a wide set of mathematical and statistical functions, including linear algebra classes, numerical algorithms such as integration and minimization, and various methods for performing regression analysis (fitting). In particular, the RooFit package allows the user to perform complex data modeling and fitting while the RooStats library provides abstractions and implementations for advanced statistical tools. Multivariate classification methods based on machine learning techniques are available via the TMVA package. A central piece in these analysis tools are the histogram classes which provide binning of one- and multi-dimensional data. Results can be saved in high-quality graphical formats like Postscript and PDF or in bitmap formats like JPG or GIF. The result can also be stored into ROOT macros that allow a full recreation and rework of the graphics. Users typically create their analysis macros step by step, making use of the interactive C++ interpreter CINT, while running over small data samples. Once the development is finished, they can run these macros at full compiled speed over large data sets, using on-the-fly compilation, or by creating a stand-alone batch program. Finally, if processing farms are available, the user can reduce the execution time of intrinsically parallel tasks --- e.g. data mining in HEP --- by using PROOF, which will take care of optimally distributing the work over the available resources in a transparent way.

	Title = {Towards an object store},
	Year = {2003},
	Abstract = {Today's SAN architectures promise unmediated host access to storage (i.e., without going through a server). To achieve this promise, however, we must address several issues and opportunities raised by SANs, including security, scalability and management. Object storage, such as introduced by the NASD work, is a means of addressing these issues and opportunities. An object store raises the level of abstraction presented by a storage control unit from an array of 512 byte blocks to a collection of objects. The object store provides ``fine-grain,'' object-level security, improved scalability by localizing space management, and improved management by allowing end-to-end management of semantically meaningful entities. This paper presents a detailed description of how an object store works and describes the design of Antara, our prototype object store. For a cache hit workload, our pure software prototype is able to service roughly 14000 4K I/O requests per second. We also present a layered security model for an object store which separates concerns of access security and network security, leveraging existing security infrastructure.},

	Abstract = {The concept of object storage was introduced in the early 1990's by the research community. Since then it has greatly matured and is now in its early stages of adoption by the industry. Yet, object storage is still not widely accepted. Viewing object store technology as the future building block particularly for large storage systems, our team in IBM Haifa Research Lab has invested substantial efforts in this area. In this position paper we survey the latest developments in the area of object store technology, focusing on standardization, research prototypes, and technology adoption and deployment. A major step has been the approval of the TIO OSD protocol (version I) as an OSD standard in late 2004. We also report on prototyping efforts that are carried out in IBM Haifa Research Lab in building an object store. Our latest prototype is compliant with a large subset of the TIO standard. To facilitate deployment of the new technology and protocol in the community at large, our team also implemented a TIO-compliant OSD (iSCSI) initiator for Linux. The initiator is interoperable with object disks of other vendors. The initiator is available as an open source driver for Linux.},

The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure. Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.

	Abstract = {In the Big Data era, both the academic community and industry agree that a crucial point to obtain the maximum benefits from the explosive data growth is integrating information from different sources, and also combining methodologies to analyze and process it . For this reason, sharing data so that third parties can build new applications or services based on it is nowadays a trend . Although most data sharing initiatives are based on public data, the ability to reuse data generated by private companies is starting to gain importance as some of them (such as Google, Twitter, BBC or New York Times) are providing access to part of their data. However, current solutions for sharing data with third parties are not fully convenient to either or both data owners and data consumers. Therefore we present dataClay, a distributed data store designed to share data with external players in a secure and flexible way based on the concepts of identity and encapsulation. We also prove that dataClay is comparable in terms of performance with trendy NoSQL technologies while providing extra functionality, and resolves impedance mismatch issues based on the Object Oriented paradigm for data representation.},

Many parallel file systems are designed to provide fast sustainable I/O in response to applications' soaring requirements. To meet this need, a novel system is imperative to temporarily buffer the bursty I/O and gradually flush datasets to long-term parallel file systems. In this paper, we introduce the design of BurstMem, a high-performance burst buffer system. BurstMem provides a storage framework with efficient storage and communication management strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that BurstMem is able to speed up the I/O performance of scientific applications by up to 8.5× on leadership computer systems.},

	Abstract = {With the rapid improvement of computation capability in high performance supercomputer system, the imbalance of performance between computation subsystem and storage subsystem has become more and more serious, especially when various big data are produced ranging from tens of gigabytes up to terabytes. To reduce this gap, large-scale storage systems need to be designed and implemented with high performance and scalability.MilkyWay-2 (TH-2) supercomputer system with peak performance 54.9 Pflops, definitely has this kind of requirement for storage system. This paper mainly introduces the storage system in MilkyWay-2 supercomputer, including the hardware architecture and the parallel file system. The storage system in MilkyWay-2 supercomputer exploits a novel hybrid hierarchy storage architecture to enable high scalability of I/O clients, I/O bandwidth and storage capacity. To fit this architecture, a user level virtualized file system, named H2FS, is designed and implemented which can cooperate local storage and shared storage together into a dynamic single namespace to optimize I/O performance in IO-intensive applications. The evaluation results show that the storage system in MilkyWay-2 supercomputer can satisfy the critical requirements in large scale supercomputer, such as performance and scalability.},

Integration between devices in the Intel{\textregistered} OPA family and Intel{\textregistered} CPUs enable improvements in system level packaging and network efficiency. When coupled with the new user-focused open standard APIs developed by the OpenFabrics Alliance (OFA) Open Fabrics Initiative (OFI), host fabric interfaces (HFIs) and switches in the Intel{\textregistered} OPA family are optimized to provide low latency, high bandwidth, and high message rate. Intel{\textregistered} OPA provides important innovations to enable a multi-generation, scalable fabric, including: link layer reliability, extended fabric addressing, and optimizations for high core count CPUs. Datacenter needs are also a core focus for Intel{\textregistered} OPA, which includes: link level traffic flow optimization to minimize datacenter jitter for high priority packets, robust partitioning support, quality of service support, and a centralized fabric management system. Basic performance metrics from first generation HFI and switch implementations demonstrate the potential of the new fabric architecture.},

	Abstract = {Resilience has become a major concern in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Addressing the increasing risk of latent errors (or silent data corruption) is one of the biggest challenges. Multi-version checkpointing system, which keeps multi-version of the application states, has been proposed as a solution and has been implemented in Global View Resilience (GVR). The resulting more sophisticated management of data introduces overheads and the resulting impact on performance need to be investigated. In this paper we explore the performance of GVR for an HPC system with integrated non-volatile memories, namely Blue Gene Active Storage (BGAS). Our empirical study shows that the BGAS system provides a significantly more efficient basis for flexible error recovery by using GVR multi-versioning features compared to using a standard external storage system attached to the same Blue Gene/Q installation. Using BGAS especially achieves at least                                                                                   {\$}{\$}10{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}                   performance boost for random traversal across multiple versions due to significantly better performance for small random I/O operations.},

	Abstract = {Hyperscale datacenter providers have struggled to balance the growing need for specialized hardware (efficiency) with the economic benefits of homogeneity (manageability).  In this paper we propose a new cloud architecture that uses reconfigurable logic to accelerate both network plane functions and applications.  This Configurable Cloud architecture places a layer of reconfigurable logic (FPGAs) between the network switches and the servers, enabling network flows to be programmably transformed at line rate, enabling acceleration of local applications running on the server, and enabling the FPGAs to communicate directly, at datacenter scale, to harvest remote FPGAs unused by their local servers.

We deployed this design over a production server bed, and show how it can be used for both service acceleration (Web search ranking) and network acceleration (encryption of data in transit at high-speeds).  This architecture is much more scalable than prior work which used secondary rack-scale networks for inter-FPGA communication.  By coupling to the network plane, direct FPGA-to-FPGA messages can be achieved at comparable latency to previous work, without the secondary network.  Additionally, the scale of direct inter-FPGA messaging is much larger.  The average round-trip latencies observed in our measurements among 24, 1000, and 250,000 machines are under 3, 9, and 20 microseconds, respectively.   The Configurable Cloud architecture has been deployed at hyperscale in Microsoft's production datacenters worldwide.},

	Abstract = {Solid State Drives (SSDs) were initially developed as faster storage devices intended to replace conventional magnetic Hard Disk Drives (HDDs). However, high computational capabilities enable SSDs to be computing nodes, not just faster storage devices. Such capability is generally called ''In-Storage Computing (ISC)''. Today's Hadoop MapReduce framework has become a de facto standard for big data processing. This paper explores In-Storage Computing challenges and opportunities for the Hadoop MapReduce framework. For this, we integrate a Hadoop MapReduce system with ISC SSD devices that implement the Hadoop Mapper inside real SSD firmware. This offloads Map tasks from the host MapReduce system to the ISC SSDs. We additionally optimize the host Hadoop system to make the best use of our proposed ISC Hadoop system. Experimental results demonstrate our ISC Hadoop MapReduce system achieves a remarkable performance gain (2.3 faster) as well as significant energy savings (11.5 lower) compared to a typical Hadoop MapReduce system. Further, the experiment suggests such ISC augmented systems can provide a very promising computing model in terms of a system scalability.},

	Year = {2016},
	Abstract = {For the implementation of data-intensive C++ applications for cache coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) systems, both massive parallelism and data locality have to be considered. While massive parallelism has been largely understood, the shared memory paradigm is still deeply entrenched in the mindset of many C++ software developers. Hence, data locality aspects of NUMA systems have been widely neglected thus far. At first sight, applying shared nothing approaches might seem like a viable workaround to address locality. However, we argue that developers should be enabled to address locality without having to surrender the advantages of the shared address space of cache coherent NUMA systems. Based on an extensive review of parallel programming languages and frameworks, we propose a programming model specialized for NUMA-aware C++ development that incorporates essential mechanisms for parallelism and data locality. We suggest that these mechanisms should be used to implement specialized data structures and algorithm templates which encapsulate locality, data distribution, and implicit data parallelism. We present an implementation of the proposed programming model in the form of a C++ framework. To demonstrate the applicability of our programming model, we implement a prototypical application on top of this framework and evaluate its performance.},

In consequence, low-power System-on-a-Chip designs are drawing much attention from the HPC community. Driven by the demand for high performance and long battery life in mobile consumer devices, all building blocks of SoCs are undergoing drastic improvements. In addition to the end-user availability of SoCs based on the ARMv8-A instruction set architecture, heterogenous aspects ranging from the big.LITTLE paradigm to compute-capable GPUs are gaining popularity. Focusing on the heterogenous nature of SoCs, we investigate both performance and energy consumption of todays state-of-the-art SoCs for heterogenous workloads using the Rodinia benchmark suite. Based on the results, we anticipate the potential of forthcoming SoC designs in the HPC domain.},

With phase two of the project starting, it is an excellent opportunity to explore the complete design and how it will address the needs of extreme scale platforms. This paper examines each layer of the proposed stack in some detail along with cross-cutting topics, such as transactions and metadata management. This paper not only provides a timely summary of important aspects of the design specifications but also captures the underlying reasoning that is not available elsewhere. We encourage the broader community to understand the design, intent, and future directions to foster discussion guiding phase two and the ultimate production storage stack based on this work. An initial performance evaluation of the early prototype implementation is also provided to validate the presented design.},

	Abstract = {Time matters. In a networked world, we would like mobile devices to provide a crisp user experience and applications to instantaneously return results. Unfortunately, application performance does not depend solely on processing time, but also on a number of different components that are commonly counted in the overall system latency. Latency is more than just a nuisance to the user, poorly accounted-for, it degrades application performance. In fields such as high frequency trading, as well as in many data centers, latency translates easily to financial losses. Research to date has focused on specific contributions to latency: from improving latency within the network to latency control on the application level. This paper takes an holistic approach to latency, and aims to provide a break-down of end-to-end latency from the application level to the wire. Using a set of crafted experiments, we explore the many contributors to latency. We assert that more attention should be paid to the latency within the host, and show that there is no silver bullet to solve the end-to-end latency challenge in data centers. We believe that a better understanding of the key elements influencing data center latency can trigger a more focused research, improving the user's quality of experience.},

Our system implementation provides methods for scaling and coordinating multiple generator/capture systems, and supports 6.25 ns timestamp resolution with clock drift and phase coordination maintained by GPS input. Additionally, our approach has demonstrated lower-cost than comparable commercial systems while achieving comparable levels of precision and accuracy; all within an open-source framework extensible with new features to support new applications, while permitting validation and review of the implementation.},

	Abstract = { The use of the Python programming language for scientific computing has been gaining momentum in the last years. The fact that it is compact and readable and its complete set of scientific libraries are two important characteristics that favour its adoption. Nevertheless, Python still lacks a solution for easily parallelizing generic scripts on distributed infrastructures, since the current alternatives mostly require the use of APIs for message passing or are restricted to embarrassingly parallel computations. In that sense, this paper presents PyCOMPSs, a framework that facilitates the development of parallel computational workflows in Python. In this approach, the user programs her script in a sequential fashion and decorates the functions to be run as asynchronous parallel tasks. A runtime system is in charge of exploiting the inherent concurrency of the script, detecting the data dependencies between tasks and spawning them to the available resources. Furthermore, we show how this programming model can be built on top of a Big Data storage architecture, where the data stored in the backend is abstracted and accessed from the application in the form of persistent objects. },

Static understanding of MPI programs informs optimizations including process placement and communication/computation overlap, and debugging.

We instantiate this to determine an approximation of the point-to-point communication graph of an MPI program. Our analysis is the first pragmatic approach to realizing the full point-to-point communication graph without profiling -- indeed our experiments show that we are able to resolve and understand 100 {\%} of the relevant MPI call sites across the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. In all but one case, this only requires specifying the number of processes.},

	Abstract = {File-system snapshots have been a key component of enterprise storage management since their inception. Creating and managing them efficiently, while maintaining flexibility and low overhead, has been a constant struggle. Although the current state-of-the-art mechanism, hierarchical reference counting, performs reasonably well for traditional small-file workloads, these workloads are increasingly vanishing from the enterprise data center, replaced instead with virtual machine and database workloads. These workloads center around a few very large files, violating the assumptions that allow hierarchical reference counting to operate efficiently. To better cope with these workloads, we introduce GCTrees, a novel method of space management that uses concepts of block lineage across snapshots, rather than explicit reference counting. As a proof of concept, we create a prototype file system, gcext4, a modified version of ext4 that uses GCTrees as a basis for snapshots and copy-on-write. In evaluating this prototype analytically, we find that, though they have a somewhat higher overhead for traditional workloads, GCTrees have dramatically lower overhead than hierarchical reference counting for large-file workloads, improving by a factor of 34 or more in some cases. Furthermore, gcext4 performs comparably to ext4 across all workloads, showing that GCTrees impose minor cost for their benefits.},

	Abstract = {Some network protocols tie application state to underlying TCP connections, leading to unacceptable service outages when an endpoint loses TCP state during fail-over or migration. For example, BGP ties forwarding tables to its control plane connections so that the failure of a BGP endpoint can lead to widespread routing disruption, even if it recovers all of its state but what was encapsulated by its TCP implementation. Although techniques exist for recovering TCP state transparently, they make assumptions that do not hold for applications such as BGP. We introduce application-driven TCP recovery, a technique that separates application recovery from TCP recovery. We evaluate our prototype, TCPR, and show that it outperforms existing BGP recovery techniques.},

	Volume = {12},
	Year = {2015},
	Abstract = {The collaboration of Internet service providers (ISPs) and content distribution network (CDN) providers was shown to be beneficial for both parties in a number of recent works. Influencing CDN edge server (surrogate) selection allows the ISP to manage the rising amount of traffic emanating from CDNs to reduce the operational expenditures (OPEX) of his infrastructure, e.g., by preventing peered traffic. At the same time, including the ISP's hidden network knowledge in the surrogate selection process influences the quality of service a CDN provider can deliver positively. As a large amount of CDN traffic is video-on-demand traffic, this paper investigates the topic of CDN/ISP collaboration from a perspective of high-volume long-living flows. These types of flows are hardly manageable with state-of-the-art Dynamic Name Service (DNS)-based redirection, as a reassignment of flows during the session is difficult to achieve. Consequently, varying load of surrogates caused by flash crowds and congestion events in the ISP's network are hard to compensate. This paper presents a novel approach promoting ISP and CDN collaboration based on a minimal deployment of software-defined networking switches in the ISP's network. The approach complements standard DNS-based redirection by allowing for a migration of high-volume flows between surrogates in the backend even if the communication has state information, such as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol sessions. In addition to a proof-of-concept, the evaluation identifies factors influencing performance and shows large performance increases when compared to standard DNS-based redirection.},

	Abstract = {Distributed key-value systems (e.g., memcached) are critical tools to cache popular content in memory, which avoids complex and expensive database queries and file system accesses. To efficiently use cache resources, balancing the load across a cluster of cache servers is important. Current approaches place a proxy at each client that can redirect requests across the cluster, but this requires modification to each client and makes dynamic replication of keys difficult. While a centralized proxy can be used, this traditionally has not been scalable. We design and implement NetKV, a scalable, self-managing, load balancer for memcached clusters. NetKV exploits recent advances in Network Function Virtualization to provide efficient packet processing in software, producing a high performance, centralized proxy that can forward over 10.5 million requests per second. NetKV efficiently and accurately detects hot keys using stream-analytic techniques, then replicates them to meet the allowed load imbalance bound set by administrators. NetKV uses ``balls and bins'' load analysis to adaptively determine the replication factor and set of hot keys. Our prototype adds minimal latency to each request, and our algorithms effectively balance load in both a 12 server cluster and a large-scale simulation driven by a trace of wikipedia requests.},

POSIX.1-2008 is intended to be used by both application developers and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated volume): a) General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including utility conventions and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume. b) Definitions for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming language, function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the System Interfaces volume. c) Definitions for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation services (a ``shell'') and common utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume.d) Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents of POSIX.1-2008 and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume. The following areas are outside the scope of POSIX.1-2008:1)Graphics interfaces 2)Database management system interfaces 3)Record I/O considerations 4) Object or binary code portability 5) System configuration and resource availability POSIX.1-2008 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance to application developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.},

This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports. Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP. Some guidance is also applicable to \ldots},
